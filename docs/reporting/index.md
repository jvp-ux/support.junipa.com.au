## Excluding evidence from Reporting

Junipa retains student records in their entirety. While evidence cannot be directly deleted, it can be excluded from reports. When excluded, evidence will no longer appear in audit reports, achieving a similar outcome.

1. Search for a student > select Manage > Evidence
2. Identify the Evidence requiring Editing (making sure to hover your cursor on this record) and select **Edit**
3. Select **Exclude evidence from reporting** and provide a reason. Select **Save**.
