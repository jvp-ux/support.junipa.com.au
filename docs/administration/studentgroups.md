# Student Groups

Setting up Junipa behind the scenes for your teaching staff.

## Student Management

Junipa provide a simple student management solution. Please talk to your Account Management if you require a more comprehensive integration.

### Steps

1. Navigate to Administration > **Students** and select **Add Student**
2. Complete the Student details form and select Save Student.
3. With the student details now saved, progress to the **Enrolments on Record** section at the bottom of the page and select **Add Enrolment**
4. Complete the **Enrolment** form:
5. This student is now enrolled, however is not in a class yet.

To add student's to a class refer to step 9 of Setting up a Timetable.

## Groups

Junipa introduced Student Groups via the new Groups feature. This feature enables schools to create cohort lists that correspond with class lists, or can be defined through alternative criteria.

### Steps to create a smart group:

1. Navigate to Administration > Students > **Student Groups**
2. Select the **create smart group** button
3. From the Group page complete the **Name**, **Description** and select the **Users** relevant to the group
   - If this group relates to a role type rather than an individual, select the relevant role within the **Assign group to users with role(s)** list
4. Select the **Year Grade** rule required for this group
5. Select the **Disability category** rule required for this group
6. Select the **Adjustment level** rule required for this group
   - If you have a general idea of the student numbers that meet the rules of this cohort then Students found for filter value should indicate this.
7. Select **Save group**

This group will now appear for the users defined within this rule, or those users that are within the roles defined within the "Assign group to users with role(s)" list

Note: For a user to see this Groups list they must be viewing the Dashboard in Groups list mode.

## Editing Groups and visibility

Junipa Groups comes in three different formats:

- Smart Group: A cohort of students defined by Year Grade, Disability category and/or Adjustment levels
- Manual Group: A cohort of students that have been manually selected one-by-one and inserted into a group
- Automatic Group: Junipa automatically creates groups of students based in their Year 11. These groups can be hidden or made visible to all users.

### Editing Smart groups

#### Steps

1. Navigate to Administration > Students > **Student Groups**
2. Identify the smart group requiring editing and select **Edit smart group rules**
3. From the Group page edit the **Name**, **Description** and select the **Users** relevant to the group
4. Edit the Year Grade, Disability category and/or Adjustment levels and select **Save**

### Editing Manual Groups

1. Navigate to Administration > Students > **Student Groups**
2. Identify the manual group requiring editing and select **Edit group rules**
3. From the Group page edit the **Name**, **Description** and select the **Users** relevant to the group
4. Edit the Year Grade, Disability category and/or Adjustment levels and select **Save**

### Disabling or Enabling an Automatic group

Automatic groups are devised for schools where staff might be stakeholders in students across all grade levels. Enabling automatic groups could introduce confusion when utilised across primary and secondary campuses.

Automatic groups are system generated and cannot be removed, however they can be disabled.

1. Navigate to Administration > Students > **Student Groups**
2. Selecting the Automatic groups tab
3. From the Automatic groups tab, identify the group that needs disabling
4. And select **Disable group**

This group will now be disabled school wide.

## Setting the default view of a dashboard

An Admin user can define the default view for other users, allowing them to see either the Timetable view or the Groups list as their default view.

### Set the default dashboard view for other users

An Admin user can define the default view for other users, enabling them to see either the Timetable view or the Groups list as their default view.

#### Steps

1. Navigate to Admin > Team
2. Select either the Timetable view or Groups toggle to change the default view for that user

## Excluding evidence from Reporting

Junipa retains student records in their entirety. While evidence cannot be directly deleted, it can be excluded from reports. When excluded, evidence will no longer appear in audit reports, achieving a similar outcome.

1. Search for a student > select Manage > Evidence
2. Identify the Evidence requiring Editing (making sure to hover your cursor on this record) and select **Edit**
3. Select **Exclude evidence from reporting** and provide a reason. Select **Save**.

## Setting up a Timetable (using Junipa's timetable functionality)

This configuration displays grade-level class list to all school teachers, allowing for bulk adjustments. A user logging in to Junipa with this configuration would see a timetable similar to the following:

### Steps:

1. Navigate to Administration > School Structure > Years
2. On the **Calendar Years** page and within the current year, select the + in the Term columns
3. Complete the form, providing a Term #, Start Date and End date and a Label (typically the same as the Term #).
4. Staying on the **Calendar Years** page, and within the current year, select the + in Grades column and add the relevant grades for the school.
5. Navigate to the Administration > School Structure > **Terms** page and create a term Timetable week by selecting + and completing the form
6. Select Save when complete.
7. Navigate to Administration > School Structure > **Subjects**, and select Add Subject and provide a name (eg - All year 11). Select Save when complete. Add additional subjects for each year level.
8. Navigate to Administration > School Structure > **Classes**, and select a Grade, Subject and provide a Class Name (eg - Year 11) and select Save when complete.
9. From the Class table, select the Students button
10. From the Class students list, add relevant students to that class.
11. Navigate to Administration > School Structure > **Schedule** and select Add Schedule Class and complete the form
12. Then select Save
13. If you have added yourself as a teacher to any of these classes, then navigate back to the Dashboard and perform a sanity check of the timetable.

**Note: repeating this step will take up most of your time setting up timetables.**
