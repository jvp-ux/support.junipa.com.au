# Student Groups

Junipa introduced Student Groups via the new Groups feature. This feature enables schools to create cohort lists that correspond with class lists, or can be defined through alternative criteria.

## Steps to create a smart group:

1. Navigate to Administration > Students > **Student Groups**
2. Select the **create smart group** button
3. From the Group page complete the **Name**, **Description** and select the **Users** relevant to the group
   - If this group relates to a role type rather than an individual, select the relevant role within the **Assign group to users with role(s)** list
4. Select the **Year Grade** rule required for this group
5. Select the **Disability category** rule required for this group
6. Select the **Adjustment level** rule required for this group
   - If you have a general idea of the student numbers that meet the rules of this cohort then Students found for filter value should indicate this.
7. Select **Save group**

This group will now appear for the users defined within this rule, or those users that are within the roles defined within the "Assign group to users with role(s)" list

Note: For a user to see this Groups list they must be viewing the Dashboard in Groups list mode.

## Editing Groups and visibility

Junipa Groups comes in three different formats:

- Smart Group: A cohort of students defined by Year Grade, Disability category and/or Adjustment levels
- Manual Group: A cohort of students that have been manually selected one-by-one and inserted into a group
- Automatic Group: Junipa automatically creates groups of students based in their Year 11. These groups can be hidden or made visible to all users.

### Editing Smart groups

#### Steps

1. Navigate to Administration > Students > **Student Groups**
2. Identify the smart group requiring editing and select **Edit smart group rules**
3. From the Group page edit the **Name**, **Description** and select the **Users** relevant to the group
4. Edit the Year Grade, Disability category and/or Adjustment levels and select **Save**

### Editing Manual Groups

1. Navigate to Administration > Students > **Student Groups**
2. Identify the manual group requiring editing and select **Edit group rules**
3. From the Group page edit the **Name**, **Description** and select the **Users** relevant to the group
4. Edit the Year Grade, Disability category and/or Adjustment levels and select **Save**

### Disabling or Enabling an Automatic group

Automatic groups are devised for schools where staff might be stakeholders in students across all grade levels. Enabling automatic groups could introduce confusion when utilised across primary and secondary campuses.

Automatic groups are system generated and cannot be removed, however they can be disabled.

1. Navigate to Administration > Students > **Student Groups**
2. Selecting the Automatic groups tab
3. From the Automatic groups tab, identify the group that needs disabling
4. And select **Disable group**

This group will now be disabled school wide.
