# Administration

Setting up Junipa behind the scenes for your teaching staff.

## Overview

This section covers various administrative tasks in Junipa, including:

- [Student Groups](./studentgroups.md)
- [Excluding evidence from Reporting](#excluding-evidence-from-reporting)
- [Setting up a Timetable](#setting-up-a-timetable-using-junipas-timetable-functionality)


## Excluding evidence from Reporting

Junipa retains student records in their entirety. While evidence cannot be directly deleted, it can be excluded from reports. When excluded, evidence will no longer appear in audit reports, achieving a similar outcome.

1. Search for a student > select Manage > Evidence
2. Identify the Evidence requiring Editing (making sure to hover your cursor on this record) and select **Edit**
3. Select **Exclude evidence from reporting** and provide a reason. Select **Save**.

## Setting up a Timetable (using Junipa's timetable functionality)

This configuration displays grade-level class list to all school teachers, allowing for bulk adjustments. A user logging in to Junipa with this configuration would see a timetable similar to the following:

### Steps:

1. Navigate to Administration > School Structure > Years
2. On the **Calendar Years** page and within the current year, select the + in the Term columns
3. Complete the form, providing a Term #, Start Date and End date and a Label (typically the same as the Term #).
4. Staying on the **Calendar Years** page, and within the current year, select the + in Grades column and add the relevant grades for the school.
5. Navigate to the Administration > School Structure > **Terms** page and create a term Timetable week by selecting + and completing the form
6. Select Save when complete.
7. Navigate to Administration > School Structure > **Subjects**, and select Add Subject and provide a name (eg - All year 11). Select Save when complete. Add additional subjects for each year level.
8. Navigate to Administration > School Structure > **Classes**, and select a Grade, Subject and provide a Class Name (eg - Year 11) and select Save when complete.
9. From the Class table, select the Students button
10. From the Class students list, add relevant students to that class.
11. Navigate to Administration > School Structure > **Schedule** and select Add Schedule Class and complete the form
12. Then select Save
13. If you have added yourself as a teacher to any of these classes, then navigate back to the Dashboard and perform a sanity check of the timetable.

**Note: repeating this step will take up most of your time setting up timetables.**
