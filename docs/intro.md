The Student Evidence record will show student's declared Disability category, Adjustment level, and Evidence log. The Evidence log will show detailed information on each evidence record:

- **Recorded date**: When the evidence was recorded. Note this date is the timestamp of the school staff member recording evidence, and will typically be after the event
- **Evidence type**: What category of evidence was recorded, and does this evidence correlate to a student's Individual Education Plans (IEP)
- **Location**: Was the evidence recorded against a class/event in the past, and is there a file attachment to be used as evidence
- **Recorded by**: Who recorded the evidence

**Note**: Only staff members with audit reporting privileges will be able to view audit data.

The IEP module is an add-on module for schools requiring integration with Individual Education Plans (IEP) and recording adjustments.
